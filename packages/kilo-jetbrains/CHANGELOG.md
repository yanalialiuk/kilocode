# Changelog

## 7.6.0

### Minor Changes

- [#13800](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13800) [`de5bdbe`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/de5bdbe448f4b5baf5dfd29f54aa6b07acfa9642) - Exclude Kilo-managed agent worktrees from the containing project's index, so a large `.kilo/worktrees` checkout no longer doubles indexing time or shows duplicate results in Search Everywhere. Toggle "Index agent worktrees" in Kilo Settings → Advanced to opt back in. Opening a worktree as its own project still indexes it fully.

- [#13766](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13766) [`399a1a5`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/399a1a5396ef3cff1c7d2ba41e18a6306ed00839) - Fork a session from the worktree editor: "Fork Session" now leads the session list's row menu, sits in the session's right-click and prompt menus, and appears on every prompt bubble's hover toolbar so you can branch off from any earlier message. The fork keeps the conversation so far, opens next to its source, and starts with a note telling the agent it is a fork and which directory it now works in.

- [#13712](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13712) [`4b604f8`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/4b604f843fa8e5cd4fde190f016294e11949c510) - Show how many pull request review conversations are still unresolved. A comment glyph with its count leads the review and CI indicators on Agent Manager worktree rows, in the pull request header, and in the row hover popup, so a branch waiting on replies is visible without opening GitHub.

  Make every element of the pull request header clickable with a hover highlight — the state badge, the title, and each verdict — and do the same for the verdict lines in the worktree row popup, which now open the pull request or its checks and explain what a click does.

- [#13712](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13712) [`1e76cdc`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/1e76cdcf3c77d61001abe55024052c3e0715cca9) - Show the run indicator on an Agent Manager worktree row while a process is running in that worktree, so a running dev server or build is visible without opening the worktree.

- [#13761](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13761) [`0554e98`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/0554e987e7e04288eb1face51f08a8bb87193b1a) - Run the project's Spring Boot, Application, and Kotlin run configurations in a worktree. The worktree Build/Run popup now lists them alongside Gradle tasks and marks which build system will execute them, so a Spring Boot app runs the worktree's own code instead of reporting "No supported run configurations". Frameworks that refuse to be built by Gradle still run, as a plain application, and say which of their settings could not come along.

  Stopping such a run terminates the application gracefully, and offers Kill for an application that outlives its build. Removing a worktree no longer leaves its application running.

### Patch Changes

- [#13765](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13765) [`63d7aad`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/63d7aadb8213f2be54e26be9128714c092fa2c41) - Stop the attention badge flickering and sticking on Agent Manager worktrees while a session runs through auto-approved edits.

- [#13712](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13712) [`048b6db`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/048b6db81870569c55c8491be61e31541a113f22) - Fade list row titles and descriptions into the row background where they do not fit, instead of ending them in an ellipsis. Applies to every list built on the shared row renderer, including the Agent Manager worktree list, the session list, and the settings lists. Turn it off with the `kilo.list.fade` registry key to leave the text cut at the row edge instead.

- [#13712](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13712) [`0408414`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/040841417a6c2c3318ad2e2ff49ea7312ab623f7) - Mark worktrees whose pull request no longer merges into its base branch. The changes-vs-base badge gets a red circle behind its trailing edge and its tooltip leads with the conflict, in the Agent Manager list, the worktree session header, and the chat PR header. The row hover popup adds a line for it that opens the pull request. Read from GitHub alongside the review and CI verdicts, so no extra `gh` call.

- [#13797](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13797) [`13ca51d`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/13ca51d80b388738c7f50e7d1707664a1b47ccac) - Render session dialog cards — questions, permission requests, login prompts, error outcomes, and the revert banner — on a filled card surface instead of an outline only, so they stand out from the chat backdrop in every theme.

## 7.6.0

### Minor Changes

- [#13764](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13764) [`17c915b`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/17c915b2a0687dc1dfe977c45bfedf2dc92b5db0) - Cycle Kilo mode, model, and reasoning effort from the chat with Ctrl+1, Ctrl+2, and Ctrl+3, and reset the model override with Ctrl+0. The same Ctrl shortcuts apply on macOS, they show up in the prompt bar's tooltips, and they can be rebound from Settings > Keymap.

## 7.6.0

### Minor Changes

- [#13756](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13756) [`f20ab7f`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/f20ab7f885955c43ba97eaed1d335c920660dfeb) - Move a session into a new worktree directly from the base checkout's worktree editor tab: a "Move to Worktree" entry now leads its session list's row menu, and sessions there get the same New Worktree / Move to Worktree toolbar above the prompt that the tool window shows. The tab's header now also reports the base checkout's uncommitted changes, the ones a move would carry.

## 7.6.0

### Minor Changes

- [#13566](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13566) [`024733e`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/024733efef372d12c9bdfb92cbec954f756cd2a5) - Add an Integrations settings page with a GitHub toggle. Turning it off stops Kilo from running the GitHub CLI, hides pull request badges and pull request import, and can be done straight from the gh warning banner.

- [#13569](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13569) [`57b0d10`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/57b0d1085de54cd392938f6830f85c428a885f2a) - Render all Mermaid diagram types natively in JetBrains chat: class, state, ER, gantt, pie, user journey, quadrant, requirement, git graph, C4, mindmap, timeline, sankey, XY chart, block, packet, kanban, architecture, radar, and treemap now join flowcharts and sequence diagrams.

- [#13588](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13588) [`4216744`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/4216744051eea4dedf981925f439564f2a81085d) - Move the v5 settings migration out of the cramped chat sidebar into a dedicated setup flow: a compact card in the session lists what needs attention with Later, Skip All, and Start, and Start opens a wider dialog with a step list on the left and the setup UI on the right, with per-step Later, Skip, and Run controls. This also lays the groundwork for future onboarding steps beyond v5 migration.

- [#13552](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13552) [`ba3613d`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/ba3613d9808adbfbe19dd9ab104fbd123b2a4d7e) - Add a right-click menu to the chat session with actions you previously had to hunt for: stop the running turn, toggle auto-approve, compare the branch against its base, open the pull request in your browser, copy the pull request reference or the session id, and share the session. Open a menu above the new "more" button on the prompt bar to access auto-approve, branch comparisons, pull request actions, session IDs, and sharing without right-clicking. Sharing creates a public link to the conversation, copies it to the clipboard, and offers to open it; sharing can be revoked from either menu. Preserve existing share links when reopening sessions. The pull request actions now also work in Agent Manager worktree session tabs, which previously had no branch actions at all.

- [#13633](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13633) [`cfbe25e`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/cfbe25e2ecac69ca931b4c9530b58a513e1fa0bb) - Add copy actions to the Agent Manager worktree row menu: copy the branch name, copy the path of the branch's worktree, and copy the pull request reference as title plus link. The copy actions are available on every row, including your main checkout, which previously offered no row actions at all.

- [#13628](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13628) [`7e5ddc0`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/7e5ddc0ae8c5fa3ff8ac86df1bb4670ff0fef623) - Show pull request review and CI status on each worktree row in the Agent Manager. The title line now carries a review verdict (approved or changes requested) followed by a build verdict (passed, failed, or running), with counts in the tooltip and a click through to the pull request or its checks.

- [#13628](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13628) [`aebd040`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/aebd040a8057d1e78a8a0baa6c9d620ee28d547b) - Hovering a worktree row in the Agent Manager now shows its full pull request detail beside the row: title, number and state, review and CI verdicts with counts, and both committed and uncommitted change counts. The popup opens on the side with more room and never covers the list.

- [#13278](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13278) [`db41227`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/db412273e586f3cca959b4ba58083aabd83bbd2f) - Run IDE run configurations per worktree from the JetBrains Agent Manager: the worktree editor header gains a Run dropdown that starts supported run configurations (Gradle and command-line style types) inside the worktree, shows and stops running processes, and opens their output in the Run tool window. Build and Rebuild actions compile the worktree with the project's build tool. Stopping behaves like the IDE's own Stop button, including a second press that force-kills processes that support it. The popup hints to open the worktree in a new frame for full run and debug support.

- [#13566](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13566) [`db6d5a5`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/db6d5a5cbcead752856341d32b8ed6fd23116e2f) - Run the worktree setup script (`.kilo/setup-script`) in a terminal when a new worktree is created, and add actions to open, create, or run it from the worktree row menu.

- [#13566](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13566) [`e6de1eb`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/e6de1ebfa3148ecc285629e00e1862116ea8ed24) - Show committed changes against the base branch on Agent Manager worktree rows, and split uncommitted changes into their own comparison in the worktree session editor header

### Patch Changes

- [#13678](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13678) [`d64bec0`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/d64bec02dd87ab6477d693d52d3b2776553a9936) - Keep Kilo's actions available while the IDE builds its indexes. Session history, worktree, and worktree session menu items no longer grey out during indexing, and their toolbar buttons no longer report that they are waiting for analysis.

- [#13635](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13635) [`037ae10`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/037ae10ccdb15cbabf1b79885e78aab6a610e821) - Fix Agent Manager and history list rows not resizing correctly when zooming the IDE interface in or out

- [#13586](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13586) [`ad5cf21`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/ad5cf21c0c21a413808fae1524c5c9256bbfe1b2) - Use the configured API key environment variable (or an already-saved key) when selecting models for a custom OpenAI-compatible provider, instead of requiring the key to be retyped every time. Also allow removing custom providers that authenticate through an environment variable, and stop a cleared environment variable from lingering in the saved configuration.

- [#13633](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13633) [`a67b3b9`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/a67b3b9be5dde8a3a3c2c1493cf54aca3f4b8f0d) - Center the "No changes" message in the diff editor instead of pinning it to the left edge.

- [#13588](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13588) [`7fcbacc`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/7fcbaccc3e4bc6a4dbf4062ff63b0a69b064d210) - Fix the v5 settings migration rerun action leaving the chat stuck on a loading spinner after the migration setup had previously been postponed with Later.

- [#13628](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13628) [`af2c45a`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/af2c45aa27bcdd1e7d5bdbf356dcd280378abd23) - Show pull request and gh authorization changes right after you come back to the IDE. Returning from a long absence now reloads immediately instead of waiting out the poll, refreshes that arrive during a burst of window or tab switches are no longer dropped, and closing a dialog no longer triggers a needless lookup. A newly created worktree also gets its pull request badge without waiting for the cache to expire.

- [#13628](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13628) [`fc8077b`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/fc8077b5124bdeca092554db9963264bfa7b55ca) - Explain it when GitHub rate limits your token instead of silently dropping every pull request badge. Kilo now keeps the badges it already resolved, says why they stopped updating, slows its checks right down until the limit clears, and picks up on its own once it does.

- [#13566](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13566) [`3402f45`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/3402f450264138eef252bf192107632ff716508e) - Refresh GitHub state as soon as you return to the IDE or switch between the Chat and Agents tabs, so authorizing gh or merging a pull request elsewhere shows up without waiting for the next poll.

- [#13551](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13551) [`1d6744e`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/1d6744e63ef90463b118d7895a2fff3cbec162f7) - Make `http`/`https` URLs written inside backticks clickable in chat messages. Previously only bare URLs became links, so URLs rendered as inline code — release links, PR links, run URLs — were inert text.

- [#13566](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13566) [`a68cb8a`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/a68cb8a03610e22895ae478304a8a1201c52778f) - Fix switching chat mode cancelling running tasks in every open worktree, and explain any task Kilo stops on its own

  Picking a mode in the chat prompt used to be saved as the CLI's global default, which made the CLI reload and cancel every task that was running anywhere. The mode now stays in the IDE and travels with each message, and it is still remembered for new chats.

  When Kilo does stop a task without being asked — a settings or provider change, for example — the chat now shows why, offers Retry, and raises a notification, instead of quietly reporting "Stopped".

- [#13633](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13633) [`a4f8242`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/a4f824224d019da68edb49cfe457f3bade751979) - Keep the rename popup's confirm button live instead of greying it out, and close without a rename when the name is unchanged or blank. Rename and delete popups now point up at the middle of the row they act on instead of covering it.

- [#13278](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13278) [`715e07f`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/715e07fed61a02debae4660e6d2e6482c01b61dc) - Fix worktree stats, pull request badges, and GitHub CLI status not loading when the IDE runs in split mode or remote development.

- [#13636](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13636) [`29b277c`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/29b277c14b0f4677e2a613c2ff6502875e20735b) - Show a changes badge on Agent Manager worktree rows while the work is still uncommitted, instead of leaving the row blank until the first commit. Clicking it opens the uncommitted comparison, and the row detail popup now opens for worktrees that have no pull request yet.

- [#13278](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13278) [`c65cb69`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/c65cb694e421dca17a4f4613868b1fe610f23f27) - Relabel the worktree editor's Run button to Build/Run with a dropdown arrow, move Open next to it, and make Terminal an icon-only button.

- [#13628](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13628) [`b6d02ec`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/b6d02ece56a1462aff35067fae611bc1a5856e8b) - Wait longer before opening a worktree row's pull request popup in the Agent Manager, so moving the pointer across the list no longer flashes a popup for every row it passes.

- [#13676](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13676) [`617cc7c`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/617cc7cdb73b34957ff7f4bbc288fe9a06fcc569) - Only open the Agent Manager worktree hover popup for worktrees that have a pull request, instead of restating the change counts already shown on the row.

- [#13566](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13566) [`3f2766f`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/3f2766f28bba7c4e6062f2c3171d690442181d23) - Fix moving a session to a worktree so it reliably transfers all changes, including from a repository subdirectory, and clearly explains that unresolved merge conflicts must be resolved first instead of failing with a confusing git error.

## 7.6.0

### Minor Changes

- [#13521](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13521) [`a453e2d`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/a453e2d231fd2275d6a0ac84bb17e3e888e29abb) - Show a branch-aware tip on the empty session screen: suggest running work in a worktree with a link when you're on a plain checkout, and confirm isolation when you're already in one.

- [#13482](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13482) [`ec94fdc`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/ec94fdc791ea52fb1faee1ec21536fc58a2f29bf) - Stop treating a manually stopped session as a failure, and add a Retry action to failed turns. Pressing Stop now shows a short "Stopped" note instead of an error badge and attention dot. Retry continues the failed turn where it stopped, keeping the conversation and any file changes it already made, and runs with the model and effort selected at that moment — so switching away from an unavailable provider and pressing Retry picks the new one up. This includes failures that never produced a reply, such as missing provider credentials.

- [#13521](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13521) [`dfaa30b`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/dfaa30b0b0fc79d2d048da6b8c94039c9d94476f) - Add a toggle to show or hide the session list in a worktree editor tab. The choice is remembered per worktree, and while the list is hidden the toggle shows the session count or flags a session that needs your attention.

- [#13396](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13396) [`b9d4d87`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/b9d4d874f76c034626e628a29f50a82b028901d0) - Render Mermaid code fences as inline diagrams in JetBrains chat markdown, and open any diagram in its own editor tab with Diagram and Source views.

### Patch Changes

- [#13396](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13396) [`54b7225`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/54b7225c4d30775cd5918aa77e410fc55889221f) - Click a diagram in chat to open it in a resizable viewer window with zoom controls, trackpad pinch zoom, drag to pan, double click to fit and scrollbars. The diagram editor tab uses the same viewer. Copying a rendered diagram, from the viewer or from chat, now puts the picture on the clipboard.

- [#13520](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13520) [`bac3e7a`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/bac3e7a7a83bdcc0ec8b93ede2fa49adb88fd133) - Show why a turn failed instead of letting the session stop with no visible reason. The reason is written once, on the turn that failed, and Retry sits below it whenever that turn can be continued. Failures the conversation has already moved past no longer leave cards behind mid-transcript, and failed sessions are flagged in history, worktree rows, and their editor tab the same way an error or a pending question is.

- [#13520](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13520) [`b3f68e0`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/b3f68e0a2ac9ecf44e3dadfec54e41f6dd1f8273) - Show a warning when a provider ends a response without signalling that it finished, instead of quietly returning the session to idle. The warning also appears when reopening the session.

- [#13521](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13521) [`d96b1b3`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/d96b1b3c3d2a5424b0d5a5ecb299731cd1e88a37) - Label the Kilo tool window's create buttons as + Session and + Worktree with a compact plus icon.

- [#13440](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13440) [`85e13e5`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/85e13e59fcb7e9cdc4d717b50e9ef92ec3e54471) - Detect a worktree's pull request reliably in Agent Manager. Imported PRs — including PRs from forks — hand-made worktrees, and locally renamed branches now show their PR badge, the current repository row gets one too, and a freshly imported PR no longer waits out the status poll. Imported PR branches also get proper git tracking, so `git push` and `git pull` work in the new worktree.

- [#13440](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13440) [`c3066e9`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/c3066e988b0d8a0b56289f410f0f2a8de640fe3d) - Stop the New Worktree dialog from flashing the previous tab's content when switching between New, From PR, and From Branch.

- [#13525](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13525) [`66e6871`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/66e687169973e917e415a6401586a24cdcf6a79a) - Stop showing a false "Git is not installed" warning for worktrees that were deleted from disk

## 7.4.24

### Patch Changes

- [#13470](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13470) [`17bef75`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/17bef75509e6fc0b8199fb19bba0ebdafb21c223) - Stop showing a running badge for a session that was just deleted.

## 7.5.0

### Minor Changes

- [#13239](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13239) [`3b8b18f`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/3b8b18ff33d2a51b620859e5bc644424ed6d5ae2) - Add an Advanced settings page with a Logging section to configure diagnostic log level and message previews, reveal the log in your file manager, and download the backend log in remote development.

### Patch Changes

- [#13315](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13315) [`ac98f5c`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/ac98f5c77460d9627ccc3e6b1a9bc09bfd327bb3) - Show compact Agent Manager activity icons for running and waiting sessions while keeping idle rows aligned with a smaller idle dot.

- [#13315](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13315) [`98928ae`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/98928aeed0c10cfe82ca2011bc49b437008bb62c) - Offer Move to Worktree in the chat toolbar whenever the repository has local changes, even before the chat has a session — the worktree gets your changes and starts its own session. New Worktree from the chat toolbar now opens its dialog first and only switches to Agents once you confirm, and the dialog opens narrower.

- [#13315](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13315) [`e9f56d4`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/e9f56d48afb1a9117f102ebfd680077012af1452) - Keep session header popups beside the chat by choosing the roomier left or right side and sizing them so IntelliJ does not flip them above or below.

- [#13315](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13315) [`d24cedd`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/d24cedd170353033b7886ed27359c378f0990df5) - Use regular PR title text and vertically center the PR badge in the JetBrains chat tool window.

- [#13315](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13315) [`f73f947`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/f73f9474ec9ee893ac58fca0b65d55009d451daf) - Add standard horizontal padding to the empty chat recent sessions list.

- [#13315](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13315) [`f60e8dc`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/f60e8dc84165fc4bbdd13a04218265fdb13da545) - Keep settings, history, and session lists on the same row and scroll position when they refresh, and select the neighbouring row after a delete.

- [#13315](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13315) [`07d2189`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/07d2189d319c47e78e70ed428b96abe4fd33de18) - Keep Agent Manager worktree selection stable when reordering worktrees and switching tabs.

- [#13239](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13239) [`f292625`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/f292625b6d264040e1379b606336631f1ca93e2f) - Use `kilo.log` as the active JetBrains plugin diagnostic log, rotate old logs to `kilo.log.0` and `kilo.log.1`, and delete legacy `kilo-dev.log*` files when logging starts.

- [#13315](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13315) [`34a7eb3`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/34a7eb34a1b9ea945a613ef0df1685676dc479a6) - Use the Kilo running spinner across session progress indicators.

Refresh the popup when server commands finish loading, and return focus to the prompt after picking a model, agent, or reasoning option from a slash command.

- [#13242](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13242) [`94c01f2`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/94c01f28565fe7b17b956250fbbf0cb3165c9afd) - Show why and how each tool call was allowed. Expanded tool cards (edits, shell commands, and every other tool) now display a shield footer such as "Auto-approved by your global config", including the matched rule or agent and an outside-workspace note. A new "Show approval reason on tool cards" toggle at the bottom of Auto-Approve settings (on by default) controls the footer.

- [#13315](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13315) [`2aee16b`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/2aee16b2ebbf4d9c607840e29f83755fd444fd9f) - Show the JetBrains tool window Chat and Agents views as tabs with shorter labels.

- [#13423](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13423) [`a5f62bc`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/a5f62bc2dbfd5f857eaaab51003941c18c0a779a) - Keep the PR badge in the JetBrains Agent Manager worktree list clickable and aligned with the rest of the row.

- [#13315](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13315) [`34a7eb3`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/34a7eb34a1b9ea945a613ef0df1685676dc479a6) - Show branch icons on Agent Manager worktree rows again, and mark the current checkout with a local machine icon.

- [#13315](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13315) [`d4f869d`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/d4f869d971a20e1a254e7994de4d40093609b10f) - Scope chat session history to the worktree you have open, so a worktree no longer lists sessions from the main checkout or sibling worktrees, and show sessions started in another project frame in Agent Manager as they happen.

- [#13423](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13423) [`80e8213`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/80e82130cd3f40af5ae5977bec9245f5404fd4c7) - Let session overlays such as the connection banner take the pointer over from the transcript beneath them, so a covered card no longer stays hovered or keeps its popup open behind the overlay.

- [#13423](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13423) [`e1e0f75`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/e1e0f7538142b9c86e09d7af6e5c803acac37db3) - Render Agent Manager worktree list labels in normal weight with quieter idle icons, tint monochrome row icons to the selection foreground while leaving status icons colored, and clear a deleted session's question/error status from the session list, worktree list, and tab attention dot.

- [#13315](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13315) [`0161c3a`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/0161c3a4baf1c710e96dc60de58927f629c940c5) - Improve JetBrains Agent Manager session status badges, selection persistence, and PR badge theming.

Running, question, and error activity now share one color between the row icon and the text badge, add an error state, and surface a notification dot on the Agents tab when a session needs attention.

- [#13315](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13315) [`d94f2bf`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/d94f2bf1c944129054dda983ff1df3d50ddced90) - Report failures when moving a chat into a worktree instead of leaving the row stuck, clean up worktrees left by a failed move, and stop clicks in empty list space from selecting the last row.

## 7.5.0

### Minor Changes

- [#13092](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13092) [`1500843`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/1500843a342d66b56bc64ac26fa6f9d60e7d255f) - Show the collapsed hover preview on more transcript cards: grep, glob, other tool calls, and to-dos now open the same popup that shell and diffs use.

- [#12433](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/12433) [`46eac53`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/46eac53716dd4c5eb31e782f55f08bcf13772ad7) - Reveal rename and delete buttons on hover in JetBrains session history, rename sessions through an inline popover instead of a modal dialog, and move the selection to the neighbouring session after deleting the selected one.

- [#12433](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/12433) [`b1a8893`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/b1a8893f142807085c4312efac62379fbcc953d5) - Show provider errors and interrupted or failed turns in the JetBrains chat instead of returning silently to idle.

- [#12433](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/12433) [`919d312`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/919d312fa4e14f44f0ad88283bbf60a1bb8a79a0) - Show an activity badge on each Agent Manager worktree row, reflecting whether that worktree's sessions are running or waiting on a question or permission — even when the worktree's editor tab is not open.

- [#12433](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/12433) [`a678e54`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/a678e549f5381db7625cc61e0897e9cb54465595) - Name Agent Manager worktrees from the first session's title. When a worktree still uses its default branch name, the title the agent generates for its first session becomes the worktree name — updating both the worktree list and the editor live as the name arrives. Placeholder session names are ignored so only the real agent title is adopted, and worktrees you have renamed yourself are left untouched. The worktree session list now also shows agent-generated session titles as they stream in.

- [#12433](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/12433) [`4100415`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/4100415acab6efaacf438ccb0648e29acd7b22a2) - Show worktree change counts, ahead/behind counts, and pull request badges in JetBrains Agent Manager worktree rows and editor headers.

- [#12433](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/12433) [`106b5f4`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/106b5f4d5aea047e21a0ddc923d98e49c78ccef8) - Add an "Open worktree in new window" button to the Agent Manager worktree toolbar that opens the worktree directory in a new IDE frame. The project is opened on the backend/host, so it also works in remote development.

- [#12433](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/12433) [`b6bd9f2`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/b6bd9f224c8c7dda632bfa16f961211f66f49a25) - Support managing sessions directly from Agent Manager worktree editor tabs, start a new session when opening an empty worktree editor, and hide non-Agent-Manager git worktrees from the worktree list.

- [#12433](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/12433) [`1d964e0`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/1d964e08254bf06de4c395bcc63a71b12f37142b) - Add a Terminal button to the Agent Manager worktree header that opens (or focuses) a terminal in the worktree's directory, reusing one terminal tab per worktree. The terminal tab is labelled with the same worktree name shown in the worktree list and editor tab, and it updates when the worktree is renamed or its pull request changes. The worktree header actions now use flat, hoverable toolbar buttons, and the branch-changes badge shows the changed-file count and lines added/removed, opening the branch diff when clicked.

- [#12433](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/12433) [`d522ff8`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/d522ff80e25e220c46cda6ed621e29025c302259) - Support renaming Agent Manager worktrees and worktree sessions from the JetBrains plugin.

- [#12433](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/12433) [`aafde0b`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/aafde0bf7e1b3263aacbff3a9c476af89dc2929d) - Show Agent Manager row actions only while hovering worktree and session rows.

- [#12433](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/12433) [`b2015b8`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/b2015b864208601aa290a1c05c7eb1384e0e7034) - Keep the JetBrains plugin connected when the optional profile request returns Bad Request.

- [#13092](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13092) [`06fc620`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/06fc620ba01cd725345d4bc457a1acb67a65a820) - Refresh the session UI colors around three tunable roles — session background, code-block background (shared by code blocks, the prompt bubble, and the input), and foreground — and apply them correctly on first paint instead of only after switching themes.

- [#13092](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/13092) [`340172a`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/340172af19bff6d31840984da600d4849b6db231) - Use a unified secondary text style for JetBrains session UI labels.

Locked worktrees are now marked in the list, the delete dialog asks for explicit confirmation before force-removing a locked worktree, a failed deletion shows a notification with a one-click force-delete retry, and selecting a worktree opens a dedicated worktree session editor tab.

- [#12433](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/12433) [`38e8220`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/38e822042c2fe9ee074f72a4001e8e2852e6ba9c) - Move the JetBrains Agent Manager selection to the neighbouring worktree after deleting the one on screen, instead of jumping unpredictably.

- [#12433](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/pull/12433) [`319d1f4`](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/commit/319d1f485917266cc4a56d620c903afa2e96125d) - Improve Agent Manager worktree activity refreshes and keep worktree list filtering responsive.

## [7.0.12-rc.2] - 2026-07-27

### Added

### Fixed

### Changed

## [7.0.12-rc.1] - 2026-07-27

### Added

- Support sending another JetBrains prompt while a session is still running. Queued prompts now appear in the conversation and can be removed before Kilo starts processing them.

- Load global skills reliably from JetBrains projects that are not inside a Git repository.
- Support adaptive thinking for Claude Opus and Sonnet 5+ model identifiers across Anthropic, AI Gateway, and Bedrock providers.
- Flush pending cloud session updates when the Kilo Core runtime shuts down, reducing cases where the final assistant message is missing when a session is reopened elsewhere.
- Prune stale bundled CLI versions after upgrading bundled JetBrains installs.

### Changed

- Update the JetBrains CLI pin from Kilo Core 7.4.15 to 7.4.16.

## [7.0.10] - 2026-07-24

### Added

- Render edit, write, and apply-patch tool results as expandable diff previews with clickable file links, change counts, syntax-highlighted diffs, and clearer multi-file patch sections.

### Fixed

- Improve session performance for large transcripts.
- Fix Kilo Core failures caused by strict OpenAI-compatible compaction requests, unexpected provider finish reasons, read-only database files at startup, AWS profile credentials, and config files being rewritten just by reading them.

### Changed

- Update the JetBrains CLI pin from Kilo Core 7.4.13 to 7.4.15.

## [7.0.9] - 2026-07-21

### Added

### Fixed

- Improve custom provider setup by validating required fields and showing configuration errors in the dialog.
- Close the custom provider dialog correctly after adding a provider.

### Added

- Add an elapsed-time indicator to the session progress footer so long-running tasks show how long they have been active.
- Support importing legacy JetBrains v5 data directly from raw storage when the previous consolidated migration file is unavailable.

### Fixed

- Restore the v5 migration wizard for users whose legacy provider, OAuth, MCP, mode, setting, or session data was not detected during upgrade.
- Improve migration reliability by preserving checklist todos, importing legacy tool calls as assistant parts, validating raw session IDs, and reducing migration memory usage.

### Changed

- Keep the JetBrains plugin pinned to Kilo Core 7.4.5 for this release.

## [7.0.4] - 2026-07-10

### Fixed

- Stop orphaned Kilo Core processes on Windows so closing the IDE no longer leaves a lingering `kilo serve` process or blocks the next IDE launch.

- Fix workspace reload recovery so stale reload state no longer disrupts the session connection.
- Fix JetBrains rollback and revert flows so prompt focus, scroll state, diff order, and turn state are preserved more reliably.
- Fix Kilo Core Bedrock SSO credential resolution and commit-message error handling when no changes are available.
