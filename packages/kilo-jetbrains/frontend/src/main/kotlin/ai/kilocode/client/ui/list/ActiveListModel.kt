 * An [icon] replaces the pill rather than joining it, so a badge is either a worded pill or a glyph. The
 * glyph form is how a row shows a status that already has a settled visual language — a CI or review
 * verdict — where a worded pill would only repeat what the icon already says.
 *
 * A glyph may still be labelled: an [icon] with a non-blank [text] renders the two side by side, in the
 * muted row color rather than a pill's own. That is the form for a status whose icon says what is being
 * counted and whose text says how many — where the icon alone would report that something is outstanding
 * without saying how much of it.
