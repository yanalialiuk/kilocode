# Kilo Code for JetBrains: Free AI Coding Plugin

## Installation

{% partial file="install-jetbrains.md" /%}

## Settings

Open **Settings → Tools → Kilo Code** to configure the plugin. The JetBrains plugin reads and writes the same shared `kilo.jsonc` config files as the CLI and the VS Code extension, so changes apply across clients. See [Settings](/docs/getting-started/settings) for config file locations and precedence.

- **Auto-Approve** — set per-tool permission levels (Allow / Ask / Deny) and manage granular command and path exceptions without editing config by hand. Permission prompts offer one-time approvals alongside saved allow/reject rules. See [Auto-Approving Actions](/docs/getting-started/settings/auto-approving-actions) for the shared permission model.
- **Context** — toggle auto-compaction, set the auto-compaction limit (the percentage of the model window that triggers compaction), enable pruning of old tool outputs, and manage file watcher ignore patterns. See [Context Condensing](/docs/customize/context/context-condensing) and [.kilocodeignore](/docs/customize/context/kilocodeignore) for what these settings control.
- **Agent Behavior → Skills** — inspect loaded skills, add extra skill sources (local paths or remote URLs), edit or remove custom skills, and open skill files in the editor. See [Skills](/docs/customize/skills) for the skill format and discovery rules.

## Reviewing session changes

- **Modified files per turn** — each assistant turn that changed files shows a **Modified** card with the affected files and their diff stats. Expand a file to see its diff inline, or open all of the turn's changes in the **Changed files** diff viewer.
- **Branch comparison** — when the workspace differs from the base branch, the session header shows a changes badge. Click it (**Compare with base branch**) to open a diff editor with a file tree and per-file navigation.
- **Stale diff refresh** — diff views detect when files change on disk and offer a **Refresh** action to reload them instead of showing outdated content.

## Permission requests

When the agent asks for several approvals at once, permission requests queue up instead of replacing each other. Resolve the current request to advance to the next one in the queue.
