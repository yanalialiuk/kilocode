# Mobile Apps

Use Kilo Code from your phone to keep coding sessions moving while you are away from your desk. The mobile app connects to Cloud Agents and remote sessions from your local CLI or editor extensions.

{% callout type="info" title="Android app available now" %}
Install Kilo Code for Android from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kilocode.kiloapp).
{% /callout %}

## What you can do

The mobile app lets you:

- View and manage Kilo Code sessions, including remote CLI and extension sessions running on your local machine.
- Spawn Cloud Agents and code directly from the app.
- Monitor and view all non-remote sessions in one place.
- Send follow-up messages while a session is still running — they are queued and processed in order.
- Run slash commands (like `/compact`) on connected remote CLI sessions, and start a new session in the same workspace with `/new`. The new session inherits the current session's mode and model. Older CLI versions that do not support remote commands prompt you to upgrade.
- Clear the visible transcript of a remote CLI session with `/clear`. Clearing is client-side only, so it works on any CLI version; server history is kept and may reappear when you re-enter the session.
- Rename a remote CLI session from the app or the CLI — renames sync in both directions.
- Review GitHub pull requests end to end — diffs, checks, comments, and merging.
- Start a new session on a connected `kilo remote` CLI instance with the **Run on** picker.

## Privacy and telemetry

On first launch, the app asks for your consent before enabling optional telemetry — product analytics, attribution, and performance tracing. Optional telemetry is pre-selected during onboarding; you can turn it off before accepting. No optional analytics starts before you make a choice.

You can review or change your decision at any time in **Settings**. Declining optional telemetry keeps you signed in, and optional telemetry state stored on the device is stopped and discarded when you revoke consent or sign out.

## Kilo Pass and Billing

## Choosing where a session runs

The new-session screen includes a **Run on** picker that chooses where your session runs:

- **Cloud Agent** — the managed cloud environment (the default).
- **A connected CLI instance** — a `kilo remote` CLI running on your own machine. The picker lists the instances currently connected to your account.

Remote sessions start with the mode and model selected on the new-session screen; older CLI versions that don't accept those fields fall back to their own defaults. The workspace is always the CLI's own checkout, so there is no repository selection — you type your first prompt in the chat after the session starts. The picker also appears in organization context, where the spawned session is attributed to the organization.

## Queueing follow-up messages

The composer stays editable while the agent is working, so you don't have to wait for a session to finish before sending your next message. Type your follow-up and press **Send** to add it to the session's queue; queued messages are processed in order. While a session is streaming, **Stop** appears only when the composer is empty — with text entered, Send takes its place.

A queued message shows a subtle **Queued** badge on its bubble. The badge clears when the message starts processing or when the queue drains or is cancelled. Queueing works for Cloud Agent sessions and for remote sessions on a connected `kilo remote` CLI instance.

## Attachments in remote sessions

When you connect the mobile app to a `kilo remote` CLI session, you can share files in both directions.

### Sending files from your phone to the CLI

Attach up to **5 files** (each up to **20 MiB**) from your phone to the remote session. The CLI automatically processes them:

- **Text, images, and PDFs** — the file content is converted to a `data:` URL and handed directly to the model as a file part. The model sees the content as if you had loaded it locally.
- **Other file types** (binaries, archives, etc.) — the file is saved to a per-session scratch directory on the CLI machine. The session transcript shows the saved path, filename, file size, and MIME type. The agent can inspect the file with the `read` tool for text content or shell utilities for binary content.

Attaching files from the phone is the mobile flow — this is separate from `kilo run --file <path>`, which attaches local files to a local prompt.

### Receiving files from the CLI on your phone

While the CLI is connected, the agent can deliver a file to your phone with the `send_file` tool (up to **4 MiB**, remote sessions only). The file appears as a chip on the tool card — tap the chip to open the share sheet and save or forward the file. This tool works only when `kilo remote` is actively connected; it is not available in Cloud Agent sessions.

## Reviewing GitHub pull requests

Open a pull request from a PR link to review it without leaving the app:

- **Overview** — PR state and CI checks at a glance.
- **Files** — syntax-highlighted diffs with line-level comments and a file navigator.
- **Discussion** — review threads with replies, resolve/unresolve, and reactions.

Comments you leave are collected into a pending review on your device and submitted to GitHub as a single review. When the PR is ready, you can merge it (merge, squash, or rebase), enable or disable auto-merge, or update the branch — all from the app.

PR review uses your connected GitHub account; the app asks you to connect GitHub if you have not already.

## Session cost and model details

The app shows what each session cost and which models did the work:

- **Session list** — a finished session with a recorded cost shows it in the row's meta line (for example, `$0.12 · 5m ago`). Sessions that are still running or have no cost show no cost.
- **Cost breakdown** — open a session's Context usage sheet to see a Token usage section (input, output, reasoning, cache read, and cache write tokens, plus the cache hit rate) and a collapsible Models section with each model's name, provider, step count, and cost. A Subagents row covers any remaining spend, so the per-model costs always add up to the session total.
- **Per-message model label** — assistant messages show a dimmed model label on the first assistant reply and whenever the model changes during the session. Turns routed by [Auto Model](/docs/code-with-ai/agents/auto-model) show the concrete model that handled the turn.

Cost is recorded when a session closes; sessions that closed before this feature shipped do not show a cost.
